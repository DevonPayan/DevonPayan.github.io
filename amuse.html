    <h1>My Amusement</h1>
    <h3>by Devon Payan</h3>
    <p>The internet is a great place to get a great gig out of. Here are somethings that I get a kick out of (not in any order).</p>

    <h2>First on the List</h2>
    <p>When I think of someone asking too many questions, this is the first video that comes to mind.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxA6k1Zw6LY">Don't worry about it</a>

    <h2>Second in the Lineup</h2>
    <p>Let's just say I never knew this was the way I needed to watch animal planet.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTZGfmlCe8w">Snoop D "O" double G</a>

    <h2>Last but not Least</h2>
    <p>When I first started making this, I didn't think Snoop Dogg would make it twice on here but he did. Must be a funny guy. Here's a clip of him and Kevin Hart commentating the Olympic games in Tokyo.</p>
