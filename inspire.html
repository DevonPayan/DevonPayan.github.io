    <p>What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore I selected Mark Cuban as a role model that I look up too most.</p>
    <p>Mark Cuban came from a middle class family, much like myself, and is now a billionare. Now, it's not just because he is a billionare that I look up to  him. I like him because I feel as if we have the same philosophy.</p>
    <p>Mark is using his financial success to help those in need. One particular way is by fighting the pharmaceutical industry. He is drastically reducing the cost of pharmaceutical drugs for patients, by only charging patients the actual cost of the drug, plus 15%, plus the phamracy fee, if any. </p>
    <p>I think what he is doing is amazing, and will help ease the financial burden of families across the country struggling to afford thier medications.  </p>
